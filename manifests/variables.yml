# Advertised memory capacity of the cells.

# We are currently doing over-provisioning of our cells.
# More info in: https://github.com/alphagov/paas-cf/pull/1126

# The following value is computed by multiplying the real cell available
# memory for the given instance type with a multiplier factor
#
# Refer to https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ for the instance mb size
#
# For instance:
#
# ruby -e 'puts "cell_memory_capacity_mb: #{ (32 * 1024 * 1.66).floor }";'
