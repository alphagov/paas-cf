# The following value is computed by multiplying the real cell available
# memory for the given instance type with a multiplier factor
#
# Refer to https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ for the instance mb size
#
# For instance:
#
# ruby -e 'puts "cell_memory_capacity_mb: #{ (30662 * 1.66).floor }";'
