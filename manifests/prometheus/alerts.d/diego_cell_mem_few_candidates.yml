          description: |
            Only {{ $value | printf "%.0f" }} cell(s) are advertising enough free memory to run a 4GiB app instance. The threshold is 3 (1 per AZ).

            The likely impact is some tenants are unable to schedule some apps, but failures may be sporadic.

            It means we don't have enough capacity to run all tenant workloads. This is probably caused by natural growth, but it is also possible
            that one or more tenant applications are scaling out beyond their intended limtis (e.g. because of a fault
            in the tenant's autoscaling policy, or a tenant starting many tasks with `cf run-task`).

            First check for something consuming a lot of excess resources, then scale the number of cells if you can't find anything. Scaling while
            something is actively consuming more and more resources likely won't fix the problem.
