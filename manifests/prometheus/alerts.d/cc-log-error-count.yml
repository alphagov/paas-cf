            Number of logged errors in Cloud Controller API grew considerably in the last hour: {{ $value | printf "%.0f" }}. See logit.io: '@source.deployment.keyword:((metrics_environment)) AND @source.component:cloud_controller_ng AND @level:ERROR'

            There is a known issue affecting Cloud Controller which spews errors logs, with very little we can do about it. This alert may be related:
